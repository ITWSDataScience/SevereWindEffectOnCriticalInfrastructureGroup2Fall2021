In this study, we aim to explore the vulnerability of power grids in the south-east region of the USA with the help of data analysis tools and machine learning algorithms.

Our work would consist of working with two relevant datasets and then combining them together on the basis of the geolocations for different power grids for a fruitful outcome.
